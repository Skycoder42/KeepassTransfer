## Installation
1. **Arch Linux:** Use the AUR-Package: [`keepass-transfer`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/keepass-transfer/)
2. **Other Linux distributions:** Install via [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/): `sudo flatpak install 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skycoder42/KeepassTransfer/master/flatpak/de.skycoder42.kptransfer.flatpakref'`
	- Flatpak packages work on any linux distribution, as long as you have flatpak installed. See https://flatpak.org/setup/ to get flatpak for your distribution
	- Alternative install method:
		1. Add The repository: `sudo flatpak repo-add skycoder42 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skycoder42/KeepassTransfer/master/flatpak/de.skycoder42.flatpakrepo'`
		2. Install: `sudo flatpak install skycoder42 de.skycoder42.kptransfer`
3. **Android:** While the apk is available as direct download, you can also get it via google play store: [KeePass-Transfer Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.skycoder42.kpt)
4. **Windows:** Get it via [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install kptransfer`
	- See [KeePass-Transfer - Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/kptransfer/) for package details
	- Chocolatey can be install using the following description: https://chocolatey.org/install#installing-chocolatey
	- You can also install the chocolatey GUI after installing chocolatey itself: `choco install chocolateygui`
5. **MacOs:** Provided via [homebrew cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask):
	1. First add the tap: `brew tap Skycoder42/qt-modules`
	2. Then install the package: `brew cask install kptransfer`

**Important:** Currently, the flatpak install is *not* available, as I have to wait for KDE to publish the Qt 5.12 runtime. See https://github.com/KDE/flatpak-kde-runtime for more details.

## Requirements
The android app requires the [ZXing Barcode Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android) to scan QR-Cpdes. If you don't already have it, you will be prompted to install it as soon as you try to scan a QR-Code. The app is not required but you won't be able to scan QR-Codes without it.

## Troubleshooting
- If you don't see the plugin action in Keepass2Android, make shure you followed these steps:
	- After installing, you opened the Keepass Transfer App once. It shows the settings (This is required for Android to actually "enable" the application on your phone)
	- Open KeePass2Android and go to settings -> plugins
	- There, select the Keepass-Transfer Plugin, and activate it
